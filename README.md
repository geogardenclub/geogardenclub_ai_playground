# firebase_vertexai_example

Sample app to show how to use Vertex AI for Firebase.

This is referenced as the "sample app" in https://firebase.google.com/docs/vertex-ai/get-started?platform=flutter

The documentation states it needs to be connected to a Firebase project, so I've connected it to ggc_app following the instructions.
